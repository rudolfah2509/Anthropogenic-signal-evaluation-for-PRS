# Anthropogenic-signal-evaluation-for-PRS
Welcome to the Anthropogenic-signal-evaluation-for-PRS wiki!
This repository will showcase autocorrelations for direct and reflected path anthropogenic signals as they travel to and through a glacier from nearby illuminators of opportunity. 
The autocorrelation plots will be of LTE, DVB-T, DAB, and GSM signals. 
Each simulation will assume a transmitter distance of 30 km, a cell tower 100 m above the glacier, with a PtGt of 8kW from the tower.

The simulations assume a direct path beam and a reflected path beam that travels through a glacier and bounces off the bedrock before it hits a receiver sitting atop the glacier. 
The autocorrelation plots show the expected delay time between when the direct path and reflected path hits the receiver. 
This delay time should correspond to the second largest peak in the autocorrelation of these two signals. 
The first peak at zero seconds represent the direct path signal, other peaks are sidelobes of both the direct path and reflected path signal.
